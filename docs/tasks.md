Task: Design wireframes for Login, Event List, Event Creation, and Event Details pages.
Task: Use a tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create wireframes.

Set Up React with Vite
Create a new Vite project:
Task: npx create vite@latest events-platform --template react
Task: cd events-platform && npm install && npm run dev
Create initial project structure (folders for components, pages, etc.):
Task: Create folders for components, pages, utils, etc.

Install and Configure Firebase
Install Firebase SDK:
Task: npm install firebase
Create firebase.js for Firebase configuration:
Task: Set up .env file with firebase keys
Task: Set up Firebase config and initialize Firestore and Authentication.
Task: Set up firebase database

Basic Structure
Create core components:
Task: Create Login, EventList, and EventCreation components.
Set up routing using React Router:
Task: Install React Router and configure routes.

UI Setup
Install and configure Tailwind CSS:
Task: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Task: Configure Tailwind in index.css.

Week 2: Core Features Implementation

Event Management
Implement event creation functionality:
Task: Build form in EventCreation component to create events.
Task: Write function to save events to Firestore.
Implement event listing:
Task: Fetch events from Firestore and display in EventList.

User Sign-Up for Events
Set up user registration:
Task: Create Firestore collection for event registrations.
Task: Implement sign-up function in EventList for users to join events.

Google Calendar Integration

Task: Create payment flow using Stripe Checkout.

Error Handling
Implement error handling:
Task: Add error messages for sign-ups, payments, and calendar issues.
Task: Display loading indicators for async operations.

Testing
Conduct thorough testing of all functionalities:
Task: Test user login, event creation, sign-up, payments, and calendar integration.
Task: Ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices.
Week 4: Final Touches and Extensions

Polish UI and UX
Finalize design elements:
Task: Review and refine all UI components for a cohesive look.
Task: Ensure all pages are responsive and accessible.

Deployment
Deploy the app:
Task: Build the project: npm run build
